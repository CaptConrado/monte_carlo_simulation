# Monte Carlo Probability Simulation

Playing around with some algorithms this one is of the [Monte Carlo Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).
Which states 
The Monte Carlo Method of simulation uses random numbers.
The steps are

* Step 1: List all possible outcomes of the experiment.
* Step 2: Determine the probability of each outcome.
* Step 3: Set up a correspondence between the outcomes of the experiment and random numbers.
* Step 4: Generate the random numbers (i.e., roll the dice, toss the coin, etc.)
* Step 5: Repeat the experiment and tally the outcomes.
* Step 6: Compute any statistics and state the conclusions.
